Hello guys, I am working on an app to add support for the minut point.
<h2>
Functions so far:</h2>
<h3>
Collection of:</h3>

*	Get temperature.
*	Get noise
*	Get battery
*	Get humidity.
*	Get pressure

<h3>Reacting to:</h3>

*	Button press
*	Temperature high
*	Temperature low.
*	Temp back to normal

<h2>Todo: </h2>

<h3>Reacting to:</h3>

*	Alarm heard.
*	Glassbreak
*	Humidity high
*	Humidity low
*	Humidity normal
*	Sound high
*	Sound normal
*	Device offline
*	Device online
*	Tamper
*	Battery low
*	Battery empty.

At the moment the app will identify itself with my name upon authentication to the Minut point API I will try and change this.

i can use some help with Icons for the app. so if anyone wants to make some icons that would be great.
